# Advanced React - Installfest

This is day one of the advanced training. Today we will focus primarily on making sure that your machines are set up for days two and three.

You should have the following done already:

* For Mac users, installed Command Line Tools and Homebrew
* For Windows users, installed Git Bash
* Installed Visual Studio Code

We will have accomplished by today:

* Installing Node.js
  * Using Homebrew: <https://changelog.com/posts/install-node-js-with-homebrew-on-os-x>
  * Using Node docs (also if on Windows): <https://nodejs.org/en/download/>
* Using Create-React-App
  * Using npm
* Answering any lingering questions

In a very perfect world, today's class may take no more than 30 minutes.
